# Hotel-Booking-EDA
I conducted exploratory data analysis on hotel bookings data and predicted cancellations of client deals. The dataset  used contains data from two different hotels. One Resort hotel and one City hotel. The data contains "bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017".
Topics covered and questions to answer from the data:
Where do the guests come from?
How much do guests pay for a room per night?
How does the price per night vary over the year?
Which are the most busy month?
How long do people stay at the hotels?
Bookings by market segment
How many bookings were canceled?
Which month have the highest number of cancelations?
